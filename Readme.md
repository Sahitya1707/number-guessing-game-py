# Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple terminal-based number guessing game built in Python. Perfect for beginners who want to sharpen their fundamentals before diving into coding platforms like LeetCode.

> üìù This README was generated as part of my learning process. I wanted to try building something small before starting LeetCode to get more comfortable with Python syntax and logic.

## Skills Practiced

This project helps reinforce core Python concepts:

- Using `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
- Control flow with `if-else`, loops, and functions
- Working with numbers and logical conditions
- Formatting clean terminal output
- Structuring reusable functions
- Handling user input safely (e.g., `try/except` or conditionals)
